# Gesture-Recognition

In this project several HMMs were trained to recognize and classify arm motions in real-time. The code was written from scratch without using any HMM libraries. 

The report outlining the techniques used and the results obtained can be found in this repository. Due to privacy concerns, the code is not available publicly - feel free to send me a message if you would like to learn more about the implementation!
